<h1>STROKE RISK ANALYSIS WEB APPLICATION</h1>

</h1> Abstract or Overview </h1>
This project aims to develop a web application for analyzing stroke risk based on a dataset containing health-related information. The main purpose of the project is to provide insights into the factors contributing to stroke risk and to offer a tool for users to explore the data interactively. Through this project, we gained insights into the correlation between various health attributes and stroke risk.

<h1> Stakeholder & Benefits </h1>
This tool would be beneficial to researchers, healthcare practitioners, and anybody interested in managing and preventing strokes. They can make educated judgements regarding treatment plans and preventive measures by using the programme to investigate relationships between various health conditions and the risk of stroke.
<h4>Real Time Scenario</h4>
Consider Dr. Smith, a medical professional, who is evaluating middle-aged patients for stroke risk. Using this application, Dr. Smith enters the medical history and demographic information for a fictitious 52-year-old patient named John Doe who has a history of hypertension and elevated average blood sugar levels. Upon entering the data, the application dynamically calculates John's stroke risk and displays interactive visualizations including histograms of similar patient profiles. Dr. Smith explores the impact of different variables like smoking status and BMI on John’s stroke risk, adjusts treatment plans, and discusses preventive strategies tailored to his specific health condition.

<h1> Data Description </h1>
The project's dataset includes details on people's lifestyle choices, medical histories, and demographics, including whether or not they have experienced a stroke. Age, gender, heart disease, hypertension, average blood sugar, BMI, smoking status, and other factors are examples of attributes. To guarantee accuracy and consistency, the data was removed and cleansed.


<h1> Algorithm Description </h1>
Several methods are used by the online application for statistical analysis, data visualisation, and data filtering. Users can use particular criteria to dynamically filter the dataset with interactive filters. Based on the chosen filters, dynamic visualizations—like histograms—provide a graphical depiction of the data. By calculating summary statistics for the filtered dataset, statistical analysis provides information on the distribution and properties of the data.


<h1>Tools used </h1>
Python: Programming language used for development.
- Streamlit: Framework for building interactive web applications with Python.
- Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: Library for creating visualizations.
- Backblaze B2: Cloud storage service for storing and retrieving data.
- dotenv: Library for loading environment variables from .env files.


<h1>Ethical Concerns</h1>
When creating a tool for health-related analysis, keep the following ethical factors in mind:
1. Data privacy: To preserve people's privacy, make sure that sensitive health data is handled securely and anonymously.
2. Bias and Fairness: Take precautions to ensure that the analysis is fair by being aware of any potential biases in the data and methods employed.
3. Informed Consent: Obtain the necessary consent before using someone's data for analysis in order to respect their right to privacy.
4. Interpretation of Results: Give concise justifications for the analytical findings and refrain from asserting false or inflated assertions regarding the model's capacity for prediction.
When data handling and analysis is done in accordance with ethical standards and best practices, the risks of privacy violations, biases, and misinterpretation of results can be minimized.
